# Description

Ah, the great American poet Edgar Allan Poe - a complicated man, and the joy/bane of all middle school English students!

Our client is an English teacher who wants to give their students an accessible way to learn Poe's poetry. Using React and the [PoetryDB API](https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb#readme), create a frontend that students can use to explore his poems within the database.

Your app should:

- Use buttons for switching between poems
  - An active button (i.e. for currently-viewed poem) should be styled differently
- Display the selected poem's title, content, and number of lines
- Provide indication if the content is still loading

The URL should be static (i.e. you will not need React-Router).

[Here is an example wireframe.](https://www.figma.com/file/aQ3LfJt3Qq2HrTZepm0Tjn/Poetry-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1)

**Bonus points for:**

- Styling (must be responsive!)
- Pagination, to show only a stanza at a time (easier to memorize that way)
